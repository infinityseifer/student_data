# Project Report: Analysis of Student Performance
## Objective:
The goal of this project was to analyze the factors influencing student performance, specifically focusing on their math_score and reading_score. We aimed to identify if variables such as gender, attendance rate, and study hours have a significant impact on student performance, using statistical techniques such as correlation analysis and regression modeling.

## Data Overview:
The dataset provided includes information about students and various factors that might influence their academic performance. The key variables of interest in this analysis were:

math_score: A numerical score representing the student's math performance.

reading_score: A numerical score representing the student's reading performance.

gender: A categorical variable (Male, Female, Other) representing the gender of the student.

attendance_rate: The attendance rate of the student as a percentage.

study_hours: The number of hours the student spends studying per week.

parent_education: The educational background of the student's parents.

The data consists of 1,000 student records.

## Exploratory Data Analysis:
## Data Cleaning:

The data was cleaned to handle missing values and ensure that all variables were in the correct format for analysis. Non-numeric categorical variables were encoded into numeric values where necessary (e.g., gender was transformed using one-hot encoding).

After checking for missing values, rows with missing data were removed to ensure the integrity of the analysis.

## Descriptive Statistics:

Summary statistics were calculated for the numeric variables (math_score, reading_score, attendance_rate, and study_hours), and frequency distributions were examined for categorical variables like gender and parent_education.

The distribution of scores showed normal-like patterns for math_score and reading_score.

## Statistical Analysis:
1. Correlation Analysis:
We performed correlation analysis to explore the relationships between math_score and other variables (e.g., attendance_rate, study_hours).

Results:

Math Score and Attendance Rate: A weak negative correlation (-0.018) was observed, suggesting that attendance rate has a minimal effect on math scores.

Math Score and Study Hours: An almost negligible negative correlation (-0.002), indicating that study hours do not significantly influence math scores.

2. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):
We performed ANOVA tests to evaluate the significance of categorical variables (gender, parent_education) on math_score and reading_score.

Reading Score and Gender: The test showed that gender did not significantly impact reading scores, with a P-value of 0.328.

Math Score and Parent Education: The analysis did not find any significant difference in math scores based on the parent's education level.

3. OLS Regression:
Multiple OLS regressions were run to evaluate the relationship between student performance (math_score and reading_score) and several predictors.

Math Score Model:

Gender showed a statistically significant negative relationship with math scores (P-value = 0.016).

Attendance rate showed a marginally significant negative effect on math scores (P-value = 0.066).

Study hours had no significant effect on math scores (P-value = 0.507).

Reading Score Model:

No significant relationships were found between gender, attendance rate, or study hours and reading scores. All predictors had high P-values, indicating no significant effect.

The model had poor explanatory power, with an R-squared of only 0.002.

## Key Findings:
1. Limited Impact of Attendance and Study Hours:

The analysis revealed weak correlations and minimal impact of both attendance rate and study hours on math_score and reading_score.

This suggests that other factors not captured in the dataset may play a more significant role in student performance.

2. Gender's Effect on Math Score:

There was a statistically significant negative relationship between gender and math_score, where male students had slightly lower math scores compared to females. However, this effect was not large, and its practical significance is limited.

3. Poor Model Fit:

Both regression models for math_score and reading_score showed low R-squared values, indicating that the independent variables in the models do not explain much of the variation in student performance. This suggests that other important factors (e.g., study methods, socioeconomic status, school environment) are likely influencing student performance but are not captured in this analysis.

4. Multicollinearity Issues:

The high condition number in the regression models indicated potential multicollinearity, meaning that some of the predictors might be highly correlated with each other. This could affect the accuracy of the regression coefficients.

## Conclusion:
The analysis suggests that gender, attendance rate, and study hours do not have a strong or significant impact on student performance in this dataset. The regression models showed low explanatory power, and there was evidence of multicollinearity. Additional variables or alternative analytical approaches (e.g., incorporating more diverse factors like social factors or academic interventions) might be necessary to build a more robust model that can better explain the variability in student performance.

Recommendations:
Incorporate Additional Variables: To improve the model, consider adding more factors such as socioeconomic status, study habits, or teacher quality.

Further Exploration of Gender: While the effect of gender on math_score was statistically significant, it is minimal. A deeper exploration of other demographic variables might reveal more meaningful insights.

Data Quality Improvement: To address the multicollinearity and improve model accuracy, it may help to examine the correlations between independent variables and either remove or combine correlated predictors.

This analysis is a starting point for understanding student performance and suggests that more comprehensive data is needed to uncover meaningful insights.
